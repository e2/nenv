## Uncomment and set this to only include directories you want to watch
directories(%w(lib spec))

## Uncomment to clear the screen before every task
# clearing :on

# Note: The cmd option is now required due to the increasing number of ways
#       rspec may be run, below are examples of the most common uses.
#  * bundler: 'bundle exec rspec'
#  * bundler binstubs: 'bin/rspec'
#  * spring: 'bin/rspec' (This will use spring if running and you have
#                          installed the spring binstubs per the docs)
#  * zeus: 'zeus rspec' (requires the server to be started separately)
#  * 'just' rspec: 'rspec'
